# DesignPatterns

Design Patterns are intended to organise your code to make it easier to manage and more readable! 

They're called "patterns" because they are often implemented in response to a common software problem (so they appear in certain states, which could be called patterns); you would see the pattern of seeing design pattern A whenever you encounter state B and problem C. 
They're not exactly a band-aid problem to all problems, but they are designed to help cover a lot of common cases and make life easier

Think of it as the software engineer's equivalent tool-set to the competitive programmer's basic algorithms like dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms; they're not something you necessarily keep in a module but more like broad concepts or ways of solving the problems that are beneficial and so far seen as optimal (or close-to!)
