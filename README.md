# DesignPatterns

Design Patterns are intended to organise your code to make it easier to manage and more readable! 
They're called "patterns" because they are often implemented in response to a common software problem (so they appear in certain states, which could be called patterns); you would see the pattern of seeing design pattern A whenever you encounter state B and problem C. 
They're not exactly a band-aid problem to all problems, but they are designed to help cover a lot of common cases and make life easier
